# UnderwaterZoo :octopus:
This application was part of an assignment for my Summer 2020 Intro Programming class. It's an application that enables players to learn and explore different sea creatures and the option to adopt thier very own.

## Assignment Challenge(s)
The biggest challenge that I face when building this application was the random method code since I didn't know how to formate that, but with my professor's help, I ended up figuring it out.

## Creature Stample Code:

```markdown
 public class Octopus : Creature
    {
        public Octopus()
        {
        }
        public Octopus(string name, string description, string interact, int sleep, ConsoleColor color)
        {
            Name = name;
            Description = description;
            Interact = interact;
            Sleep = sleep;
        }
    }
```
